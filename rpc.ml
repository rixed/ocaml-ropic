     *   termination itself. This cost a hashtable lookup, though.
     * - we need to associate an id with each query and store every continuations in a hash to send the proper
     *   answer to the proper continuation, since you may call the server several times before an answer is
     *   received, and the server is not constrained to answer in sequence (since it may itself depend on a
     *   backend). Since the hash of cnx is global and the id is global as well, we can imagine a query
     *   being answered by another server, which is cool or frightening.
     * - as a result, if we store several servers on this program they can share the same cnxs if they
     *   speak to the same dest
